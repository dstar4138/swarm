swarm - Fast acceptor pool for Erlang
======================================

swarm is a fast and simple TCP and SSL connection acceptor pool library.

Overview
------------------

swarm is based loosely on ranch and much credit is due to LoÃ¯c Hoguin for
basic interface design. The swarm interface resembles ranch's, but under
the hood things are a bit different.

In particular, swarm passes transport options straight through, so all
options are available, and it provides a more complete transport interface
on top of gen_tcp and ssl (e.g. DN parsing for SSL client certs). 

The swarm acceptor design is simple, but follows the mochiweb tradition
rather than the cowboy/ranch tradition, in that the accepting process 
becomes the working process, and the listener spawns another acceptor 
(based on a replacement strategy) to replace it. This design can be 
tuned to optimize for low-latency burst handling or for one-for-one 
acceptor replacement. It also removes the need to synchronize over the 
passing of socket control to a child process.

Motivation
------------------

swarm is a key ingredient in middleman, a scalable and modular TCP, SSL,
and HTTP reverse proxy. Middleman requires a number of features not
provided by ranch, and the simplest path was to build a new acceptor 
library.

swarm is intended to be fast and simple and to get out of the way, so it
is unlikely to receive significant new features.

Using swarm
------------------

* Add swarm as a rebar dependency:

```erlang
  {swarm, ".*", {git, "https://github.com/jeremey/swarm.git", {branch, "master"}}}
```

Then you can use swarm as a separate application tree: 

* Start the application, then add listener pools with a particular handler:

```erlang
  swarm:start(),

  Handler = {my_handler, handle, []},
  AltHandler = fun() -> ... end,
  {ok, Pid} = swarm:start_listener(my_app, 100, swarm_tcp, [{port, 8080}], Handler).
```

* Or, you can add swarm to your own application tree:

```erlang
  swarm:child_spec(my_app, 100, swarm_tcp, [{port,8080}], Handler)
```
